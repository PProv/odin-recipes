        <h3>Yields: 4 servings | Prep Time: 10 minutes | Cook Time: 20 minutes | Total Time: 30 minutes</h3>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>8 oz. penne pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked balck pepper (or to taste)</li>
            <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Zest and juice the lemon. You'll need about ½ tsp zest and 1 Tbsp lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes, or until tender). Before draining,
                reserve about 1 cup of the starchy water from the pot. </li>
            <li>Place the frozen peas in the colander before draining the pasta so the pasta will thaw the peas as it drains.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and minced garlic to a large skillet and sauté over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the
                garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the drained pasta and peas, and about ½ cup of the starchy pasta cooking water to the skillet with the butter
                and garlic. Stir to combine, then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Add the ricotta, Parmesan, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and ½ teaspoon lemon zest to the skillet. Stir until everything
                is well combined, the residual heat from the skillet and pasta have warmed the ricotta, and the ricotta has formed a
                creamy sauce. Add more of the warm reserved pasta water if needed.</li>
            <li>Season the pasta with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
