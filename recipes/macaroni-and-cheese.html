        <h2>Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to
        prepare when you have so many exotic and expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple recipe
        is cheap and tasty.</h2>
        <h3>Yields: 6 servings | Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cook Time: 15 minutes | Total Time: 30 minutes</h3>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 c. dried macaroni</li>
            <li>1 whole egg</li>
            <li>1/4 c. salted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 c. whole milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 c. whole milk</li>
            <li>2 tsp. dry mustard, more if desired</li>
            <li>1 lb. cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. salt, more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. ground black pepper</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the macaroni until very firm. The macaroni should be too firm to eat right out of the pot. Drain.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, melt the butter and sprinkle in the flour. Whisk together over medium-low heat. Cook the mixture for
                5 minutes, whisking constantly. Don’t let it burn. Pour in the milk, add the mustard, and whisk until smooth. Cook
                for 5 minutes until very thick. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Take 1/4 cup of the sauce and slowly pour it into the beaten egg, whisking constantly to avoid cooking the egg.
                Whisk together till smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture into the sauce, whisking constantly. Stir until smooth. Add in the cheese and stir to melt. Add
                the salt, seasoned salt and pepper. Taste the sauce and add more salt as needed! DO NOT UNDERSALT.
                Pour in the drained, cooked macaroni and stir to combine. Serve immediately (very creamy) or pour into a buttered
                baking dish, top with extra cheese, and bake at 350˚ for 20 to 25 minutes, or until bubbly and golden on top.</li>
        </ol>
